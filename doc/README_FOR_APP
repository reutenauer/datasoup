Coming soon: documentation of the application code.

Main parts of the code:
app/controllers for the controllers.
app/views for ... the views.
The code that would normally be in the models is in lib, as Rails
insists that models should be connected to a database by default, and we
donâ€™t have any at this point.

The main interface with DataSift is thus is lib/resque_job.rb, that is
used to queue Resque jobs (background tasks); these write their output
to a Redis database, that is polled by the front-end code.
